  pseudo-tests:
    arithmetic       Runs arithoh, short, int, long, float, double,
                     and whetstone-double
    dhry             Alias for dhry2reg
    dhrystone        Alias for dhry2reg
    whets            Alias for whetstone-double

    speed            Runs the arithmetic and system groups
    oldsystem        Runs execl, fstime, fsbuffer, fsdisk, pipe, context1,
                     spawn, and syscall
    system           Runs oldsystem plus shell1, shell8, and shell16
    fs               Runs fstime-w, fstime-r, fstime, fsbuffer-w,

    shell            Runs shell1, shell8, and shell16

    index            Runs the tests which constitute the official index:
                     the oldsystem group, plus dhry2reg, whetstone-double,
                     shell1, and shell8
                     See "The BYTE Index" below for more information.
    graphics         Runs the tests which constitute the graphics index:
                     2d-rects, 2d-ellipse, 2d-aashapes, 2d-text, 2d-blit,
                     2d-window, and ubgears
    gindex           Runs the index and graphics groups, to generate both
                     sets of index results

    all              Runs all tests

Quickstart
==========

$ svn checkout http://byte-unixbench.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ byte-unixbench-read-only

Usage:
    ./Run [ -q | -v ] [-i <n> ] [-c <n> [-c <n> ...]] [test ...]
      -q            Run in quiet mode.
      -v            Run in verbose mode.
      -i <count>    Run <count> iterations for each test -- slower tests use <count> / 3, 
                    but at least 1.  Defaults to 10 (3 for slow tests).
      -c <n>        Run <n> copies of each test in parallel.

Standard index tests:
    $ ./Run
    [Note] After about 29 minutes the results are in ./results

Graphic tests (requires x11perf):
    $ vi Makefile
        GRAPHIC_TESTS = defined
    $ ./Run graphics
    [Note] After about 18 minutes the results are in ./results

Both:
    ./Run gindex (run graphic and index tests)

Run a single test:
    ./Run syscall

Cross-compile
=============

$ make CC=powerpc-debian-squeeze-linux-gcc
    --> binaries: ls pgms/*

$ vi Run
    -my $cCompiler = 'gcc';
    -"C" => {
    -    "logmsg" => "C Compiler Throughput ($cCompiler)",
    -    "cat"    => 'misc',
    -    "prog" => "${BINDIR}/looper",
    -    "options" => "60 $cCompiler cctest.c",
    -},
[Note] had to fix one build error with times
    Ref: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9948508/errors-while-compiling-dhrystone-in-unix
[Alt] $ vi Run --> my $cCompiler = 'powerpc-debian-squeeze-linux-gcc';
